# YATRAA BACKEND

Yatraa is a vehicle tracking system assists public transportation users in their movements by 
providing real-time information on the location of vehicles. People use public 
vehicles often to go from one place to another. But the main problem is they donâ€™t 
know the route to destination and which bus to use. The vehicle tracking system 
project offers user to find the route to the destination along with the required fare 
and the estimated time to reach to the destination.
